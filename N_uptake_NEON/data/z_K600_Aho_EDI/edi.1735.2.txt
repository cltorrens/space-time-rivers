         This dataset contains estimates of gas exchange velocity, gas exchange rate, and hydraulic parameters for streams calculated from tracer-gas experiments and conservative tracer injections collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). All input data were collected by NEON and is available on the NEON data portal at https://data.neonscience.org. Specifically, the NEON Reaeration field and lab collection data product (DP1.20190.001) was used to calculate these estimates. Gas exchange was estimated in two ways: first, following an unpooled frequentist approach and second, following a partially pooled Bayesian approach.  In addition, a salt-correction was applied to gas exchange estimates for sites where it was possible and necessary.  All estimates of gas exchange are included in the file gasExchange_ds.csv.  A recommended selection of these estimates is included in the dataset (best_k600_mPerDay and best_K600_mPerDay).  The stanfit objects used for the partially pooled Bayesian approach are also included as site-specific model objects for gas exchange velocities and rates.  In addition, water velocity was calculated from conservative tracer injections, and mean water depth was calculated from these water velocity estimates and measurements of wetted width and water discharge.  All hydraulic parameters are included in the file hydraulics_ds.csv. All processing code is available in the reaRates R package.

               The methods used to estimate gas exchange and hydraulic parameters are documented in a companion manuscript that will be simultaneously submitted for review (Title: Gas exchange velocities (k_600 ), gas exchange rates (K_600 ), and hydraulic geometries for streams and rivers derived from the NEON Reaeration field and lab collection data product (DP1.20190.001) by Kelly S. Aho, Kaelin Cawley, Robert Hensley, Robert O. Hall, Jr., Walter Dodds, Keli Goodman). 
               In short, the data processing pipeline used to create this dataset leverages the reaRate R package (Cawley et al., 2024).  The package estimates gas exchange velocity (k_600) and gas exchange rate (K_600) from data available on the NEON data portal.  The data products used are the NEON Reaeration field and lab collection data product (DP1.20190.001) and the Discharge field collection data product (DP1.20048.001). Data processed is included in RELEASE-2023, plus nine additional experiments that were provisional but are now included in RELEASE-2024. The package works by fitting an exponential, first-order decay function (C_x= C_0 e^(-K_d x), where C_0 and C_x are tracer-gas concentrations at the top of the study reach and at a downstream point x, respectively, and K_d is the average distance traveled by an SF6 molecule before it is emitted to the atmosphere) to the observed longitudinal decline in published SF6 concentrations and solving for K_d.  For sites where lateral inflows (e.g., groundwater inputs, overland flow, tributaries) appear to dilute SF6 concentrations, the ratio of SF6 to NaCl or NaBr is used to calculate a salt-corrected K_d value. The reaRate package uses the peaks of NaCl breakthrough curves (i.e., either from continuous injection or slug injections) to estimate the travel time between the upstream and downstream stations and then calculates v as the distance between stations divided by the travel time.  Finally, k_SF6 and K_SF6 are calculated from K_d, v, and z  (k_SF6 = z  ν K_D) and then normalized to k_600 and K_600 (k_600=k_SF6 (600/Sc_SF6 )^(-0.5)). The reaRates package includes two approaches to estimate k_600 and K_600: an un-pooled frequentist approach and a partially pooled Bayesian approach, both of which are describe in more detail in the companion data paper.  Implementation of the package and all processing described below were conducted in R 4.2.3 (R Core Team, 2023). More information about the package, including details about the individual functions and a processing pipeline, is available in the companion data descriptor.
