READ.ME for NEON autotrophic uptake

Goal: partition and quantify autotrophic uptake in NEON streams
- How much of total uptake is autotrophic
- How well does the single-station N model work for these streams/ NEON sites?  
- 	KEY: what is K, and how does the effective reach length (K*velocity) compare to the length of continuous reach above the sensor site? E.G. the reach w/o dams, tributaries, other discontinuities

More info: K = the daily turnover rate for (in this case) nitrate (units d-1). NO3 and O2 have different turnover rates (because O2 equilibrates w the atmosphere and NO3 does not), therefore different reach lengths. This is why a 2-station N model is recommended when comparing the two (Hensley and Cohen, 20XX 14?). However, if the effective reach length (K*velocity) is shorter than the continuous reach above the sensor site, it indicates that NO3 turns over quickly enough to ‘refresh’ itself *within the presumed reach* just like O2, thus the two compounds can effectively be compared using 1-station models

Units: 
N, Ne, N_pred, etc. = umol L-1 (NEON units) = mmol m-3 
U, U_het, U_tot, etc. = mmol m-2
K = d-1
Light (streamMetabolizer) = 
Light (satellite) = 
Depth (z) = m
Velocity = m d-1
Vf, uptake velocity =
